ChivoChop is an almost complete ecommerce, it is localhost, therefore it must be mounted on the PC to be able to run it. It does not have a payment gateway, everything is simulated as it would be if you were already working for a company.

For the site to function correctly, you must follow the following steps.
Step number 1: You must move the chivochop folder to the htdocs of your MySQL database management system, for example Xampp or Wampp.
Step number 2: You must turn on Mysqli and Apache.
Step number 3: You will need to create a database called chivochop in phpmyadmin.
Step number 4: You will need to import the sql that is in the folder in the database that you created in the previous step.
Step number 5: In the navigation bar, search through localhost for the site (localhost/chivochop) and you will be able to enjoy the site.
